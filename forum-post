S: Uzbl OS

B: [i]This is not finished yet. I am looking into some input on the problems I am facing.[/i]

So I thought it would be a good idea to create "Uzbl OS", like Chrome OS. It is a very simple web oriented Linux distro. It starts up in "Kiosk" mode, so everything is configured via the web browser (uzbl).

It is based off of Arch Linux, larch, Uzbl, and Ratpoison.

Security Issues:
I have added the function "platform.shell(COMMAND)" to the Uzbl Javascript via the Uzbl ~/.config/uzbl/config file. This is accessible to all Web applications. The function runs under the user "web", that is not in the sudoers file. It seems safe to me, but I bet there are some security issues with it.
[b]I'd like web applications to be able to get root permissions via a dialog like gksudo, but [/b]

Miscellaneous:
[*] There are no packages of Uzbl right now, and I'm waiting for the libwebkit/segfault problem to be fixed.
[*] It's configured for i686 right now, change run "sed 's|i686|x86_64|' pacman.conf > pacman.conf" for x86_64.
[*] The default server is my home server: http://bauer.dnsdojo.com/. This is okay for now, but eventually I might want to move to a better server.
