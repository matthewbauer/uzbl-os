# This script allows you to focus another uzbl window
# It considers all uzbl windows in the current tag
# you can select one from a list, or go to the next/previous one
# It does not change the layout (stacked/tiled/floating) nor does it
# changes the size or viewing mode of a uzbl window
# When your current uzbl window is maximized, the one you change to 
# will be maximized as well.
# See http://www.uzbl.org/wiki/wmii for more info
# $1 must be one of 'list', 'next', 'prev'
